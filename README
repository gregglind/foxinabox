Do you need to build Firefox, but don't have time to muddle through build dependencies and wiki pages?
Try FoxInABox, a VM that comes with a full, standard Firefox build environment out of the box.

Usage:
$ sudo gem install vagrant
$ vagrant up

At this point, there should be a new foxinabox VirtualBox machine in ~/VirtualBox VMs which you can run.


Known issues:

*** On OSX, running |vagrant up| can result in the following output:

> [default] Extracting box...
> [default] Cleaning up downloaded box...
> /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/archive-tar-minitar-0.5.2/lib/archive/tar/minitar.rb:493:in `read': undefined method `size' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
>	from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/archive-tar-minitar-0.5.2/lib/archive/tar/minitar.rb:740:in `extract_entry'
>	from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/archive-tar-minitar-0.5.2/lib/archive/tar/minitar.rb:739:in `loop'
>	from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/archive-tar-minitar-0.5.2/lib/archive/tar/minitar.rb:739:in `extract_entry'
> ...

This can be fixed by re-running |vagrant up| until the operation succeeds.


*** Starting up the VM for the first time is really slow

First the OS image needs to be downloaded (~350 MB), then mozilla-central needs to be cloned (~700 MB), and a bunch of packages need to be installed.
This takes time, and puppet is really bad at providing output while long-running tasks are in operation. Just ignore the process and check back in
every 15 minutes.
